{"name":"VastSpace","tagline":"VastSpace import test","body":"VastSpace GitHub Pages\r\n======================\r\n\r\n\r\n** This document is a draft.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's this?\r\n------------\r\n\r\nVastSpace is a 3-D realtime strategy game engine that I have\r\nbeen developing to test ideas I wanted to try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding Windows Client\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nRun svn-bullet.bat BEFORE opening a Visual Studio solutin file.\r\nYou need a Subversion client installed on your computer\r\nin order to run the batch file.\r\n\r\nSupported target version of Visual Studio is currently only\r\n2008 and 2012 (Express).  Building with 2010 could be possible,\r\nbut I haven't gave it a try.\r\n\r\nWith Visual Studio 2012, you will need to manually change\r\nplatform toolset to \"Visual Stuido 2012 (v110)\" in the IDE\r\nproperty page.  This is because premake4 does not support\r\nVS2012 yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding Linux Server\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nInvoking gnu make will build the application.\r\n\r\nYou'll need various external libraries:\r\n  libpng\r\n  The IJG's JPEG library (version 7 or later)\r\n  zlib\r\n  Bullet Dynamics Engine (version 2.76 or later)\r\n  Squirrel Scripting Language version 3\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes about history\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nI had been tracking history of the project with Subversion for long time,\r\nso you may see remnants of that age in places.\r\n\r\nIt took 1200 commits to confirm that Git worths to migrate from Subversion.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this software was written in 2004 and it was named Gltest,\r\nbecause that project's purpose is to test OpenGL features.\r\nAs I added various ideas to that project, I end up thinking that creating\r\na fully simulated space war game is great.\r\nSeveral years later, I switched the main language for the project to C++\r\nfrom plain C.  The project's name was changed to Gltestplus at that time.\r\nSubversion history starts since that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
