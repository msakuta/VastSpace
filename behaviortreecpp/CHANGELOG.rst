3.2.0 (2020-03-22)
------------------
* root_node removed in favour of a method. tickRoot() added
* Moving to c++14
* fixed compilation on ROS2 and ubuntu 18.94
* fix compilation and unit tests
* Boost coroutine (`#164 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/164>`_)
  Remove the faulty coroutine that created significant problems in favour of boost::coroutine2 (use older boost::coroutine as a fallback).
* doc fix
* Fix issue `#140 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/140>`_
* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP
* (issue `#163 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/163>`_) fix ded code
* Merge pull request `#162 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/162>`_ from unvestigate/master

* Tree is declared as a struct, so it needs to be forward-declared as a struct too.
* Merge pull request `#161 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/161>`_ from unvestigate/master
  A couple of small changes needed to build on MSVC2015
* The __cplusplus macro does not work properly prior to MSVC2017 15.7 Preview 3: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-now-correctly-reports-__cplusplus/
* MSVC2015 seems to need an explicit operator== for comparing against literal strings.
* [Breaking API change] make TreeNode::setStatus() protected
  Users are not supposed to set the status of a node manually from the
  outside. This might be a source of hard to debug errors as seen in
  Navigation2 of ROS2.
  If this change breaks your code, there is an high probability that your
  code was already broken.
* fix warning
* comments
* Update action_node.h
* Fix bug in default port values
* fix issue `#141 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/141>`_

  [ImgBot] Optimize images
* Merge pull request `#156 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/156>`_ from HansRobo/patch-1
  Fix error message
* Modify documentation images.
  SequenceNode:
  AimTo -> AimAt
  "Aim at a target" might sound more appropriate in this example than "aim to reach a goal".
  SequenceStar:
  Sequence -> ReactiveSequence
  The text says "On the other hand, isBatteryOK must be checked at every tick,
  for this reason its parent must be a ReactiveSequence."
  Modify the image to match the text.
* Fix bug `#149 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/149>`_
* Merge pull request `#152 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/152>`_ from happykeyboard/add_unix_BUILD_SHARED
