/* rseq.h
 * pseudo-random number sequence generator object
 * which generates exactly the same sequence by the same seed number.
 *
 * This header defines a structure and 2 macros. The structure is
 * struct random_sequence, for storing random sequence status. It is
 * the caller's responsibility to allocate memory space for the structure
 * object, by simply declaring the structure object. The structure is at
 * least of size 64 bits, and period of random sequence is at most 2^64,
 * which is approximately 1.8 x 10^19.
 * The one is init_rseq, for initializing random sequence status object,
 * and the other is rseq, for actually retrieving next number of random
 * sequence.
 * The point of saying these routines are macros are that they may evaluate
 * the arguments more than once (which may cause problems in case such a call
 * like 'rseq(a++)' is invoked), and a pointer to a function cannot be
 * retrieved for them.
 * The function versions of the macros are available, with their name postfixed
 * with a 'f'. If you use them, be sure to compile and link "rseq.c" as well.
 *
 * Semantics
 *
 *   struct random_sequence;
 *   void init_rseq(struct random_sequence *, unsigned long seed);
 *   unsigned long rseq(struct random_sequence *);
