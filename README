Building Windows Client
-----------------------

Run svn-bullet.bat BEFORE opening a Visual Studio solutin file.
You need a Subversion client installed on your computer
in order to run the batch file.

Supported target version of Visual Studio is currently only
2008 and 2012 (Express).  Building with 2010 could be possible,
but I haven't gave it a try.

With Visual Studio 2012, you will need to manually change
platform toolset to "Visual Stuido 2012 (v110)" in the IDE
property page.  This is because premake4 does not support
VS2012 yet.


Building Linux Server
---------------------

Invoking gnu make will build the application.

You'll need various external libraries:
  libpng
  The IJG's JPEG library (version 7 or later)
  zlib
  Bullet Dynamics Engine (version 2.76 or later)
