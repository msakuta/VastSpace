<p>** This document is a draft.</p>

<h2>What's this?</h2>

<p>VastSpace is a 3-D realtime strategy game engine that I have
been developing to test ideas I wanted to try.</p>

<h2>Building Windows Client</h2>

<p>Run svn-bullet.bat BEFORE opening a Visual Studio solutin file.
You need a Subversion client installed on your computer
in order to run the batch file.</p>

<p>Supported target version of Visual Studio is currently only
2008 and 2012 (Express).  Building with 2010 could be possible,
but I haven't gave it a try.</p>

<p>With Visual Studio 2012, you will need to manually change
platform toolset to "Visual Stuido 2012 (v110)" in the IDE
property page.  This is because premake4 does not support
VS2012 yet.</p>

<h2>Building Linux Server</h2>

<p>Invoking gnu make will build the application.</p>

<p>You'll need various external libraries:
  libpng
  The IJG's JPEG library (version 7 or later)
  zlib
  Bullet Dynamics Engine (version 2.76 or later)
  Squirrel Scripting Language version 3</p>

<h2>Notes about history</h2>

<p>I had been tracking history of the project with Subversion for long time,
so you may see remnants of that age in places.</p>

<p>It took 1200 commits to confirm that Git worths to migrate from Subversion.</p>

<p>The first part of this software was written in 2004 and it was named Gltest,
because that project's purpose is to test OpenGL features.
As I added various ideas to that project, I end up thinking that creating
a fully simulated space war game is great.
Several years later, I switched the main language for the project to C++
from plain C.  The project's name was changed to Gltestplus at that time.
Subversion history starts since that time.</p>
